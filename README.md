# Practice and Experimenting with DeepSets
### Purpose 
I wrote this to practice autograd and better understand the model and experiments 
in the [Deep Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06114) paper (Zaheer et al., NeurIPS 2017)

The use of autograd was inspired by the [code](https://github.com/HIPS/neural-fingerprint) for the paper [Convolutional Networks on Graphs for Learning Molecular Fingerprints](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5954-convolutional-networks-on-graphs-for-learning-molecular-fingerprints.pdf) by Duvenaud, Maclaurin, et al. in NeurIPS 2015.
